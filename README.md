# AI-Tic-Tac-Toe

This project implements a Tic-tac-toe game where you can play against an AI that uses the Minimax algorithm to make its moves.

## About

Tic-tac-toe is a classic game where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

In this project, you can play against an AI that is designed to make optimal moves using the Minimax algorithm, ensuring a challenging game.
